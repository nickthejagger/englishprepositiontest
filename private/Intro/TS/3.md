These prepositions are also used to talk about time. Again, to help us know when to use them, we need to learn the rules.
1.	IN: Preposition in is used to talk about an event that happens during the period of time. For example, The new semester starts in July.
2.	ON: Preposition in is used to talk about an event that happens on a day or date. For example, I go to church on Sunday.
3.	AT: Preposition in is used to specifically say when an event happens. For example, Classes start at 6.45. 

If you haven’t remembered the rules above, it’s okay. During this online lesson, we will explain how sentences match the rules. We hope the rules in the lesson can help you remember and make better prepositional decisions.
